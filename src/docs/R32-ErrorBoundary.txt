Error Boundary
A class component that implements either one or both of the lifecycle methods
getDerivedStateFromError or componentDidCatch becomes an error boundary.

The static method getDerivedStateFromError method is used to render a fallback
Ul after an error is thrown and the componentDidCatch method is used to log
the error information.


Summary
- Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript error in their child
component tree,log those errors,and display a fall-back Ul.

- A class component becomes an Error Boundary by defining either or both of
getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycle methods.

- The placement of the Error Boundary also matters as it controls if the entire app
should have the fall-back Ul or just the component causing the problem.

- Provide a way to gracefully handle error in application code.
