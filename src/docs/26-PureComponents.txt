-> a regular component doesnot implements shouldComponentUpdate method it is always return true
-> a pure component implements shouldComponentUpdate with shallow prop and state comparison
  => shallow comparisons (SC)
    - premitives types
    a SC b returns true if a and b are the same value as well types
    - complex types
    a SC b returns true if a and b are the same exact object
    ie let x= [12,4,2]; let y = [12,4,2]; let z = x  
    SC(x,y) => false ; SC(x,z) => true

    Hence component will rerender when props or state differs from the previous one in pure component


Summary
We can create a component by extending the PureComponent class.
A PureComponent implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method by performing a
shallow comparison on the props and state of the component.
If there is no difference,the component is not re-rendered-performance boost.
It is a good idea to ensure that all the children components are also pure to avoid unexpected
behaviour.
Never mutate the state.Always return a new object that reflects the new state.
