Mounting
 - When component is created or inserted in dom
 - constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render and didMount

 - constructor
 - static getDerivedStateFromProps
 - render
 - componetDidMount 

Updating
 - When a component rerenders either of props or state changes
 
 - static getDerivedStateFromProps
 - shouldComponentUpdate
 - render
 - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate 
 - componentDidUpdate (for sideEffects)

Unmounting
 - When a component is removed from the dom

 - componentWillUnmount

ErrorHandling
 - When there is error during rendering, in a life cycle method 
   or in the constructor of life cycle hook

  - static getDerivedStateFromError 
  - componentDidCatch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> ComponentMountingLifeCycle
  1- constructor
   - called when the component is created
   - initializing state and binding event handlers
   - donot cause side effects .Ex : fetching data from server

   example 
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = { name: '', age: ''};
    }

  2- static getDerivedStateFromProps
    - used to update the state based on the props
    - donot cause sideeffects

  3- render
    - donot intract with dom / change the state of component or make ajax call
    - children components lifecycle also executed

  4- componentDidMount
    - perfect for side effects like fetching data from server
    - invoke after component and all its children are rendered

  componentWillUnmount
  - Cancelling any network request
  - Cleaning up the dom
  - Unbinding event handlers
  - Cancelling any timers
  - Cancelling any animation
  - Cancelling any interval
  - Cancelling any timeout
  - ⚠️ donot call setState
  
  componenentDidCatch(error, info)
  - used to handle error either during rendering 
  or in the life cycle method or in constructor
